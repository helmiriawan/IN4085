# IN4085 - Pattern Recognition

This is the repository for the final assignment. The goal of this assignment is
to classify individual digits by using pattern recognition techniques.

## Scenario
There are two scenarios:
- the classifier is trained with large amount of training data (at least 200
and at most 1000 objects per class) and should have lower than 5% test error.
- the classifier is trained with smaller amount of training data (at most 10
object per class) and should have at least 25% test error.

## Software
[PRtools](http://prtools.org/) version 5.3.2 is used in this assignment,
based on the recommendation for this course. You can download the software from
[here](http://37steps.com/software/).

## Data set
Data set for this assignment is standard data set of handwritten digits by
[US National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST)](http://www.nist.gov/).

## Functions
Please add the `functions` directory to your MATLAB path before run the scripts.
You can do that by using `addpath` statement. For example, use command below
to add `home/username/functions` to your path.

```
addpath home/username/functions
```
